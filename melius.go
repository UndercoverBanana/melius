// Melius is an open source GUI Library oriented around OpenGL.
// While developing the library, I tried to keep an immediate mode pattern in mind.
// Although not necessarily immediate mode, Melius can easily get a window up and running with only a few lines of code!
//
// Also while writing the library, I took many courses on UI programming for HTML/CSS to create the perfect base
// for the library. I attempted to design it so that it looked good right out of the box. Obviously, the library has the capability
// to be styled even more, but having a good base to work with isn't too bad!
